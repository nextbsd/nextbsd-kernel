/*
 * NextBSD in-kernel IORegistry (K1, nextbsd#214).
 *
 * A read-only, on-demand in-kernel view of the live newbus device_t tree,
 * presented as IOKit-style nodes + property bags and queryable from userland
 * via ioctl on /dev/ioregistry. This is the kernel-served replacement for
 * hwregd's tree: hwregd is merely a userland cache of hw.bus sysctls plus
 * /dev/devctl events, whereas this walks the real device_t tree directly.
 *
 * PR1 (#214) is kernel-only and read-only: it builds no shadow tree, it walks
 * the live newbus topology on demand. A stable uint64 registry id is minted per
 * device_t (and lingers, marked detached, after the device goes away) so a
 * userland iterator never dangles. The libIOKit migration (later PR) consumes
 * this ABI; keep these structs frozen once shipped.
 *
 * See pkgdemon.github.io/nextbsd-inkernel-iokit-feasibility.html.
